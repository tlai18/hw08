###  Questions  ###

For question 1, read the intro to section 7.4 and read section 7.4.1 about
the components of nano-ML's type system. 

 1. We have seen the symbols ρ, τ, and σ before, but not used exactly in
    this way. 

    Here is a list of semantic and type-related concepts you have seen
    written using single symbols:

      - an expression
      - a name
      - a location
      - a value
      - a type
      - a type scheme (new in this chapter)
      - a mapping from names to locations
      - a mapping from names to values
      - a mapping from names to types
      - a mapping from names to type schemes (new in this chapter)

    There are lots of concepts and only so many symbols to go around.
    Please identify, from the preceding list, what each symbol stands
    for in the theory of nano-ML:

    (a) τ

    > ...your answer here...

    (b) σ
    
    > 

    (c) Γ
    
    > 

    And finally, 

    (d) Say briefly what, in nano-ML, is the difference between τ and σ:

For question 2, first read the first two paragraphs of section 7.4.3 (stopping
at "A substitution is a finite map...") about automatic instantiation.  These
paragraphs introduce the notion of a substitution, which we represent
mathematically with a "theta" $θ$. Next, read the rest of the text here in the
CQs file to learn more about substitutions and instantiations.

Richard thinks a substitution is best understood as a mapping or function from
some set of type variables to a set of types. Since a substitution is a
function, it can be composed with other substitutions to produce a new one. Here
are two different substitution examples, the first mapping a type variable
α to the type "int", the second composing two substitutions together (one
that maps type variable α to type variable β, another mapping type
variable β to type "bool"):

  $θ1$ = `(α → int)`

  $θ2$ = `(α → β) ∘ (β → bool)`

A substitution can be 'applied' to anything involving types (e.g., a type, a
type scheme, a type-equality constraint), and doing so replaces any type
variables in the domain of the substitution with their corresponding types. For
example, applying $θ2$ to some type "tau" would first replace any β in
"tau" with "bool" (giving "tau-prime"), then it would replace any α in
"tau-prime" with β.

We can use this notion to formalize the idea of a type "instance". Specifically,
given two types τ and τ', we say that τ' is an "instance" of τ if there is some
substitution θ such that τ' = θ(τ). For example, "int" is an instance of type
variable α, because substitution $θ1$ above can be applied to α to yield the
type "int". "bool" is also an instance of type variable α, because we could make
some other substitution that maps α to type "bool".

We can extend this instance relation to type schemes. We say that type τ' is an
instance of type scheme ∀ α1,...,αn.τ  if there's some substitution θ such that
τ' = θ(τ) AND θ only maps a subset of the type variables {α1, ..., αn}. In other
words, the substitution θ is only allowed to map type variables that are bound
by the ∀. Finding such a substitution and applying it to the polymorphic type
scheme to obtain a monomorphic type is called "instantiating" the polymorphic
type scheme.  When we instantiate a type scheme, we may substitute for the type
variables mentioned by the ∀ *and only for those variables.* This is like
instantiation in Typed uScheme (e.g., [@ cons int]), except in nano-ML the type
system instantiates each type scheme automatically without programmer
assistance!


 2. (a) Yes or no: does the substitution `(α → sym) ∘ (β → bool) ∘ (γ → int)`
        replace type variable `α` with type `sym`?

        >

    (b) Yes or no: does the substitution `(α → sym) ∘ (β → bool) ∘ (γ → int)`
        replace type variable `β` with type `bool`?

        >

    (c) Yes or no: does the substitution `(α → sym) ∘ (β → bool) ∘ (γ → int)`
        leave the type `γ list` unchanged?

        >

    (d) Which of the following nano-ML type expressions, written in concrete
        nano-ML syntax, are *instances* of the polymorphic type scheme 
        `∀α . α list → int`?  
        
        For each one, please indicate whether it is an instance of the type
        scheme (True) or whether it is not an instance of the type scheme
        (False). 
        
        `(list int)`   True or False

        >

        `(list (list int))`  True or False

        >

        `((list (list int)) -> int)`  True or False

        >

        `((list int) int -> list)`  True or False

    _You have a foundation on which to build for exercise 2._

For questions 3-5, read the first two pages of section 7.5.2 about the form of
constraints and how they can be used to write deterministic typing judgements
for IF and APPLY expressions in nano-ML. Then read all of section 7.5.3, which
explains how to solve constraints by finding substitutions.

 3. Consider the following substitution θ and constraint $C$:

    > $θ$ = `(α₁ ↦ int)`
    >
    > $C$ = `α₁ ~ α₂ /\ α₂ ~ α₃ list /\ α₄ ~ α₃ list list`.

    Now define $C' = θ(C)$.
    
    (a) Write $C'$:

    >
    
    (b) Does $C'$ have a solution?  Answer yes or no.

    >

    Now define $C''$ as the result of applying substitution `(α₂ ↦ int)` to $C$.

    (c) Write $C''$:
    
    >

    (d) Does $C''$ have a solution?  Answer yes or no.

    >
    

    _You are getting ready for exercise 2._



 4. To demonstrate your understanding on how to solve constraints,
    reason about solving these four constraints:

    > `C₁ = α ~ int`
    >
    > `C₂ = α ~ bool`
    >
    > `C₃ = C₁ /\ C₂`
    >
    > `C₄ = α₁ ~ α₂ /\ α₂ list ~ α₁`

    (a) Write a substitution `θ₁` that solves constraint `C₁`:
       
    >


    (b) Write a substitution `θ₂` that solves constraint `C₂`:

    >


    (c) Does the composition `θ₂ ∘ θ₁` solve constraint `C₃ = C₁ /\ C₂`?
        Answer yes or no.

    >


    (d) Can constraint `C₃` be solved? Answer yes or no.

    >


    (e) Can constraint `C₄` be solved? Answer yes or no.

    _You are ready for exercise 2._

The readings done so far have told you the components of nano-ML's type system
(7.4.1), substitutions and instances, constraints and how they're generated in
some nano-ML typing rules (7.5.2), and how to solve constraints by finding
substitutions. But how are these ideas combined in a full-fledged type inference
algorithm?

At a high level, the type inference algorithm implements the typing judgement
C, Γ ⊢ e : τ.  That is, given a mapping from names to polymorphic type schemes
(Γ) and an expression to type check (e) as inputs, the algorithm produces a
monomorphic type τ and a constraint C as outputs. If constraint C is satisfied
(i.e., if we can find a substitution that solves it), then expression e has type
τ. Most expressions produce "interesting" constraints when they're type checked,
but any with a "known" type (e.g., literals of monomorphic type or variables
whose names are already present in Γ) just produce the trivial constraint `T`.

As an example, consider type inference for expression (+ 3 2) with a type
environment Γ = { + : `∀.int × int -> int }. According to the APPLY rule on page
421, we have to first type check sub-expressions `+`, `3`, and `2`.  I'll first
type check sub-expressions `3` and `2`, which in each case produces the type
'int' and the trivial constraint `T` (since numeric literals always have type
'int'). Formally, we have `T, Γ ⊢ 3, int` and `T, Γ ⊢ 4, int`. 

For type checking `+`, note that it's already bound to a type scheme in Γ; thus
type checking it will just produce the trivial constraint `T`. But what type
will be output for `+`? Recall that type inference has to produce both a
constraint and a type, but Γ maps names to type _schemes_ that use `∀`, which
aren't types. So how do we go from the schemes in Γ to the types we want? This
is where _instantiation_ comes into play. If a name is _used_ in the code (like
`+` in this example), its type scheme ∀ α1,...,αn.τ gets instantiated by (1)
substituting some subset of the type variables {α1,...,αn} in τ with fresh type
variables that haven't been used anywhere else and (2) removing the ∀ and its
associated type variables. If a type scheme has an empty ∀ (i.e., that symbol is
immediately followed by a dot), then instantiating is easy: just remove the ∀
and you have your type! So instantiating the type scheme for `+` gives us type
`int × int -> int` (I just removed the `∀.`). Formally, we have 

  `T, Γ ⊢  +, int × int -> int`

Taken together in the APPLY rule, we can derive the following (with
unnecessary parentheses added around the constraints imposed by the APPLY
rule to help read it):

T /\ T /\ T, Γ ⊢ `+`, 3, 2 : int × int -> int, int, int   'a is fresh
----------------------------------------------------------------------
T /\ T /\ T /\ (int × int -> int) ~ (int × int -> 'a), Γ ⊢ (+ 3 2) : 'a

In this case, the big conjunction in the conclusion and the type 'a would be the
outputs of type inference for expression (+ 3 2).

 5. Now consider type inference for the following expression e:
    
        (f 3 #t)
        
    For this question, assume the following:

      - Expression `3` has type `int`, with a trivial constraint.
      - Expression `#t` has type `bool`, with a trivial constraint.
      - Trivial constraints can be ignored.
      - Every type variable *except* `'a`, `'b`, and `'c` is "fresh."
    
    Answer both parts:
    
    (a) Assume that `f` is bound in Γ to the type scheme `∀.'a × 'b → 'c.`
        (The `∀` is supposed to be empty and the `×` separates distinct
        arguments to the function.) 
        In judgment C, Γ ⊢ e : τ, what does the type checker output for τ?

        >

        And what does the type checker output for C?

        >

    (b) Assume that `f` is bound in Γ to the type scheme `∀.'a`.
        In judgment C, Γ ⊢ e : τ, what does the type checker output for τ?

        >

        And what does the type checker output for C?

        >

    _You are ready for some of the easier parts of exercise 3._

For questions 6-7, read the paragraphs from the top of page 414 ("A function
is well typed...") to the middle of page 415 that describe the nondeterministic
typing rules for `lambda` and for "Milner's Let". The small paragraph following
the `lambda` rule is particularly important for understanding notation. Note
that although code chunk 414 defines a function called `too-polymorphic`, some
references to that that function in this reading call it `too-poly`.

 6. Now look at the `val` definition of `too-polymorphic` in code chunk 414.
    The right-hand side of the `val` definition is a `lambda`
    expression with the name `empty-list` playing the role of `x₁`.
    
    (a) The rule for `lambda` says that we can pick any type `τ₁` for
        `empty-list`.  After we've chosen `τ₁`, what is the *type
        scheme* to which `empty-list` (playing `x₁`) is bound in the
        extended environment which is used to check $e$?
        (Hint: this type scheme comes from the `lambda` rule,
        as per the discussion in the small paragraph, and it is
        *different* from the type scheme of the `empty-list` that
        appears in the top-level `val` binding.)
        

        >


    (b) Given that the rule for `lambda` says that we can pick any
        type `τ₁` for `empty-list`, why can't we pick a `τ₁` that makes
        the `lambda` expression in too-polymorphic type-check?  
        Put the word YES next to the best explanation:

          - Parameter `empty-list` has to have type `(forall ('a)
            (list 'a))`, but `τ₁` is not a `forall` type.

          - Parameter `empty-list` has type `τ₁` = `(list 'a)`, which is
            not the same as `(list bool)`.

          - Parameter `empty-list` can have any type `τ₁` but no `τ₁` can
            be equivalent to both `(list int)` and `(list bool)`.

          - Parameter `empty-list` has type `τ₁` = `(list bool)`, which
            is not the same as `(list int)`.

          - Parameter `empty-list` has type `τ₁` = `(list int)`, which
            is not the same as `(list bool)`.



    _You are ready for exercise 1 and for one of the hard parts of exercise 3._

 7. Now look at the definition of `not-too-polymorphic` in code chunk 415.
    The right-hand side is an example of Milner's `let` with
    `empty-list` playing the role of $x$, the literal `'()` playing
    the role of $e'$, and an application of `pair` playing the role
    of $e$.  Suppose that Γ ⊢ `'()` : β list, where β is a type variable
    that does not appear anywhere in Γ.  That is to say, the literal
    `'()` is given the type β list, which is playing the role of τ'.

    (a) If τ' is β list, what are its free type variables?

        >


    b) What set in this example plays the role of `{ α₁, ..., αₙ }` in Milner's
        Let, which is ftv(τ')-ftv(Γ)?

        >
    

    (c) What is the *type scheme* to which `empty-list` (playing x) is 
        bound in the extended environment which is used to check $e$?

        >


    _You are ready for all of exercise 3._
